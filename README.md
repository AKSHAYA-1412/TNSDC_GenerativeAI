Project Title: "Building a Smarter AI Powered Spam Classifier (SVM Algorithm)"

Agenda: The project aims to develop a robust spam classifier using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, enhancing email and text message filtering systems to mitigate spam-related issues effectively.

Problem Statement: Traditional spam filters often struggle to accurately identify spam messages amidst evolving tactics employed by spammers, leading to increased instances of unwanted emails and texts flooding users' inboxes.

Solution Modelling: Leveraging the SVM algorithm, the project constructs a sophisticated spam classifier capable of learning and adapting to various spam patterns, effectively distinguishing between legitimate and spam messages based on their features.

End Users: End users include individuals, businesses, and organizations seeking to enhance email and text message security and efficiency by implementing a more intelligent spam filtering system.
